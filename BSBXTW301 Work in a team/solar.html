                        Ten schools have been selected, including Belridge Secondary College where the announcement was made, to receive commercial batteries and solar panels - if they do not already have them.
                        The batteries will enable schools to store their excess energy for later use, which will assist with grid stability.

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Our Impact</h3>
                    <p class="section-text">
                        A VPP is a network of distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles that are 'aggregated' and shared with an energy retailer.

The schools, located in the South West Interconnected System, were determined by Synergy and the Department of Education based on operational, customer, system and technical considerations.

Using Virtual Power Plants mean there is less of a need for traditional generation assets such as coal or gas, which is a step towards a more sustainable power system.

This initiative forms part of the McGowan Government's Distributed Energy Resources Roadmap - for transitioning towards a cleaner, energy future.

The $4 million investment forms part of the McGowan Government's $66.3 million renewable energy technologies package from the WA Recovery Plan, which will boost innovative, clean energy projects throughout Western Australia.

The McGowan Government is focused on enhancing renewable energy technology at more schools across the State.
