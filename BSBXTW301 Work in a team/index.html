                    Belridge High School has implemented an extensive power-management policy across all campus computer labs and administrative workstations. By configuring every desktop and laptop to enter power-saving mode after a predetermined interval of inactivity, the district ensures that machines automatically shut down when not in use. This strategy significantly reduces unnecessary electricity consumption overnight, during weekends and holiday breaks, and even between classes. In addition to the automated shutdown feature, Belridge’s IT department has installed energy-efficient power supplies and optimized system settings—such as dimming displays and disabling nonessential background processes—to further minimize the school’s carbon footprint. As a result of these measures, the entire school benefits from lower utility costs, an extended lifespan for hardware components, and a demonstrable commitment to environmental stewardship that aligns with broader district sustainability goals.

                    <p class="section-text">
                        By automatically shutting down or sleeping machines after periods of inactivity, the school cuts back on wasted electricity. Even if each computer only saves 20 W when idle, across 500 machines that’s 500×20 W=10,000 W=10 kW500×20 W=10,000 W=10 kW saved whenever labs or offices are unattended. Over 1,000 hours of downtime per year, this equates to 10 kW × 1,000 h = 10,000 kWh of electricity not consumed. At $0.12 per kWh, the annual savings approach $1,200.

                        Fewer operating hours mean reduced wear on hard drives, cooling fans and power supplies. Components running in low-power modes generate less heat and stress, lowering failure rates and delaying costly replacements.

                        Cutting back on electricity demand lessens the school’s carbon footprint. If the local grid emits roughly 0.5 kg CO₂ per kWh, then saving 10,000 kWh avoids around 5,000 kg of CO₂ emissions annually equivalent to planting over 180 mature trees. .
